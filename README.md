# Predict Dropout or Academic Success

## Abstract

This project represents prediction of study outcomes of students enrolled in academic studies between 2008/09. and 2018/19. academic year using machine learning methods. The dataset we used contains 37 attributes about socio-economic, demographic and macroeconomic characteristics of students, but also attributes about success before enrolling at faculty, as well as about the success achieved at the end of the 1st and 2nd semesters.
After exploratory data analysis and selection of the most important attributes, we started training classifications models, and as models we used Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Rree, Bagging classifier, Random Forest, Ada Boost and Gradient Boosting. 
The best results we achieved using Logistic Regression model, with F1 measure of 0.84 for successful outcome and 0.77 for unsuccessful study outcome.
